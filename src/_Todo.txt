A minimalist audio player: just what I need to listen to music, and nothing more.

Objectives:
 - Play .mp3 and .flac files
 - Be portable, no installer required
 - Be the smallest executable possible, with the fewest (and smallest) dependancies possible
 - Look reasonable

 Assumes:
 - User doesn't need a music 'manager' and can figure out how to drag and drop what they want to listen to into Rejive

 Todo:
  - ID3 Tagging, or have an 'online' toggle. When on, fetch pictures / ID tag data from online music service, cache this. Make the feature opt in?
  - program a visualisation
  - program wave form as a replacement for track bar for user to navigate track position within song
