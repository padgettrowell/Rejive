A minimalist audio player: just what I need to listen to music, and nothing more.

Objectives:
 - Play .mp3 and .flac files
 - Be portable, no installer required
 - Be the smallest executable possible, with the fewest (and smallest) dependancies possible
 - Look reasonable

 Assumes:
 - User doesn't need a music 'manager' and can figure out how to drag and drop what they want to listen to into Rejive

 Todo:
  - remove navigatable track
  - remove scan types
  - move media playback to bass.net or some other single file decoder??
  - compare resource usage of MCIPlayer and MediaElementPlayer
  - do I **need** pictures?
  - Have an 'online' toggle. When on, fetch pictures / ID tag data from online music service, cache this. Make the feature opt in
  - program a visualisation
  - Add audio bitrate info
  - do i need:
	- Random?
	- Shuffle?
 - make the whole app a drop zone for dragging in files
 - change XML serialisation of .profile to json, or a text file
 - Remove objectlist dependancy?
